<p class="gen">
I am a Computer Engineer and a technology enthusiast borned and raised in Argentina.
I have started my carrer in IT and working with GNU/Linux and Unix back in 2001.
Have been involved from the top of analysis and architectural design to the implementation and on-going administration of a wide range of projects.
Throughout my career I've dealt with many different technologies such as virtualization, public and on-prem clouds, most kinds of clusters, monitoring, storage, information security, networking, automation, kubernetes, and many other cool technologies.
And also played many roles: starting in consulting, then moving to unix/linux support, solution engineer, team leader, instructor, teacher, DevOps and finally architect.
Currently employed as Cloud Success Architect at Red Hat, helping customers across EMEA region to deal with emerging technologies like OpenShift, OpenStack, Ansible and Ceph.
