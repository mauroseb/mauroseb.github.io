<p class="gen">
I am a Computer Engineer born and raised in Argentina. I define myself as a technology and OpenSource software enthusiast. I started my career in IT working with GNU/Linux and Unix systems back in 2001. Have been involved from the top of analysis and architectural design to the implementation and on-going administration of a wide range of projects in Fortune 500 companies.
My role as Sr. Cloud Architect from the Customer Success department, allows me to deal daily with customers from any kind of industries, as a technical advisor in cloud technologies, I had the chance to help dozens of customers across the EMEA region to reach their business goals through emerging technologies like OpenShift, OpenStack, Containers, Kubernetes, Ansible and Ceph.
During the 20 years of my career I have dealt with other different technologies, and play different roles along the way, from tech lead to architect.
As a side activity, I have always been an advocate of teaching and sharing knowledge, which drove me to become early in my career a chair assistant in Operating Systems class at my home university, then moving to private education services as a Red Hat Certified Instructor, technical writer, and recently delivering Red Hat technology trainings to local universities.
